## üö® Common Issues

### Fix Missing Streaks
```sql
-- Create streak records for goals that don't have one
INSERT INTO public.streaks (goal_id, user_id, current_streak, longest_streak, total_completions)
SELECT g.id, g.user_id, 0, 0, 0
FROM public.goals g
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM public.streaks s WHERE s.goal_id = g.id AND s.user_id = g.user_id
)
AND g.goal_type = 'recurring';
```

### Reset User's Test Data
```sql
-- WARNING: This deletes all data for the authenticated user
DELETE FROM public.goals WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
-- Other tables will cascade delete automatically
```

### Repair Constraint Violations
```sql
-- Fix goals with completed flag but no completed_at
UPDATE public.goals
SET completed_at = updated_at
WHERE is_completed = true
  AND completed_at IS NULL;
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. Always use `auth.uid()` in queries to respect RLS
2. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
3. Index columns you frequently query or join on
4. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to optimize slow queries
5. Keep transactions short to avoid locks
6. Use batch operations for multiple inserts
7. Test queries in SQL Editor before using in code
