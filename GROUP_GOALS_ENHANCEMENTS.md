```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Display Group Goal Card
```tsx
import { GroupGoalCard } from '@/components/group-goals'

<GroupGoalCard
  goal={goal}
  members={members}
  isAdmin={isOwner}
  onViewDetails={() => router.push(`/goals/${goal.id}`)}
/>
```

### Member Selection
```tsx
import { MemberSelector } from '@/components/group-goals'

const [selectedMembers, setSelectedMembers] = useState<string[]>([])

<MemberSelector
  selectedMembers={selectedMembers}
  onMembersChange={setSelectedMembers}
  maxMembers={20}
/>
```

### Auto-Activate Goals
```sql
-- Run the migration
\i auto-activate-goals.sql

-- Manually activate now
SELECT * FROM activate_goals_now();

-- Check pending goals
SELECT id, title, start_date, status 
FROM goals 
WHERE status = 'pending' AND start_date <= NOW();
```

## 🔔 Notification Flow

```
1. Admin creates group goal
   ↓
2. System sends notifications to all invited members
   type: 'accountability_request'
   action_required: true
   ↓
3. Members see invitation in notifications
   ↓
4. Member accepts/declines
   ↓
5. Admin receives response notification
   ↓
6. Accepted members can access goal
```

## 📊 Database Changes

### New Columns (from previous migration)
- `goals.is_group_goal` - Boolean flag
- `goals.group_goal_status` - Status tracking
- `goal_activities.assigned_to_all` - Collaborative flag
- `goal_activities.activity_type` - Individual/collaborative

### New Triggers
- `trigger_auto_activate_goal` - Real-time activation
- `trigger_handle_completion` - Completion handling

### New Functions
- `check_goal_activation()` - Activation logic
- `auto_activate_pending_goals()` - Batch activation
- `activate_goals_now()` - Manual trigger
- `handle_goal_completion()` - Completion logic

## 🎯 Admin vs Member Permissions

| Feature | Admin (Creator) | Members |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Edit goal details | ✅ | ❌ |
| Invite members | ✅ | ❌ |
| Remove members | ✅ | ❌ |
| Assign activities | ✅ | ❌ |
| Complete own activities | ✅ | ✅ |
| Send encouragement | ✅ | ✅ |
| View progress | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Run `group-goals-system.sql` (schema)
- [ ] Run `auto-activate-goals.sql` (activation)
- [ ] Deploy updated frontend code
- [ ] Test notification delivery
- [ ] Verify auto-activation trigger
- [ ] Test member selector
- [ ] Verify pink shadow styling
- [ ] Test encouragement system
- [ ] Verify admin badges

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Cron Job**: Requires pg_cron extension (enable in Supabase dashboard)
2. **Real-time**: Trigger provides immediate activation without cron
3. **Notifications**: Uses existing `accountability_request` type
4. **Max Members**: Limited to 20 for performance

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Activity comments/discussion threads
- [ ] File attachments for activities
- [ ] Activity reminders via email/push
- [ ] Group goal templates
- [ ] Leaderboard for member progress
- [ ] Activity dependencies
- [ ] Recurring group goals
- [ ] Export progress reports

## 📞 Support

### Auto-Activation Not Working?
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_activate_goal';

-- Manually activate
SELECT * FROM activate_goals_now();

-- Check pending goals
SELECT * FROM goals WHERE status = 'pending' AND start_date <= NOW();
```

### Notifications Not Sending?
```typescript
// Check notification creation
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('notifications')
  .select('*')
  .eq('type', 'accountability_request')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10)
```
