# Group Goals Enhancement Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements

### 1. Admin-Only Edit/Delete Permissions ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `lib/group-goals.ts` with `isGroupGoalAdmin()` function
- Only goal owner (creator) can delete/edit group goals
- `deleteGroupGoal()` notifies all members automatically
- `updateGroupGoal()` checks admin status before allowing changes
- Admin dropdown menu in `group-goal-detail.tsx` for edit/delete actions

**Database:**
- RLS policies enforce admin checks at database level
- Admin role determined by `user_id` on goals table matching current user

---

### 2. Activity Assignment with Progress Tracking ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Activities support `assigned_members` array for multi-member assignments
- Only assigned members can update their activities via `canUserEditActivity()`
- Progress tracking via `getActivityProgress()` shows:
  - Individual completion status per assigned member
  - Overall activity progress percentage
  - Visual progress bars in UI
- Activity reassignment when members decline (database trigger)

**Database Schema:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE goal_activities ADD COLUMN assigned_members UUID[] DEFAULT '{}';
CREATE FUNCTION reassign_declined_member_activities() -- Auto-reassigns on decline
```

**Files:**
- `lib/group-goals.ts` - Activity permission logic
- `lib/database/group-goals-enhanced-schema.sql` - New schema
- `components/group-goals/activity-assignment.tsx` - Assignment UI

---

### 3. Enhanced Group Goal Pages with Modern UI ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Added comprehensive member details (join date, role, progress)
- Progress tab shows individual member completion percentages
- Admin actions dropdown with edit/delete/manage options
- Tabs layout: Activities, Members, Progress, Support
- Modern gradient styling with pink/purple theme
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Files:**
- `components/group-goals/group-goal-detail.tsx` - Complete redesign
- `components/group-goals/group-goal-card.tsx` - Enhanced card design

---

### 4. Smart Due Date Logic ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Created `lib/utils/goal-status.ts` with comprehensive status calculation
- Status types: completed, paused, overdue, active, upcoming
- Handles special cases:
  - Completed goals show completion date
  - Paused goals display "Paused" status
  - Resumed goals past due show "Overdue (Resumed)"
  - Overdue goals show days overdue
  - Active goals show days until due
- `GoalStatusBadge` and `CompactGoalStatus` components for consistent display

**Usage Across App:**
```tsx
import { getGoalStatus, getDueDateText } from '@/lib/utils/goal-status'
const status = getGoalStatus(goal) // Returns comprehensive status info
```

**Files:**
- `lib/utils/goal-status.ts` - Status utility functions
- `components/goals/goal-status-badge.tsx` - Reusable status components
- Updated in `group-goal-card.tsx` to use new components

---

### 5. Progress Update Logic Based on Member Acceptance ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- `checkAllMembersResponded()` - Checks if all invitations are responded to
- `canUpdateGroupGoalProgress()` - Returns permission status with reason
- Progress updates blocked until:
  1. All members accept or decline invitation
  2. At least one member accepts
- UI shows alert when updates are blocked
- Clear messaging explains why progress can't be updated

**Logic Flow:**
```
Group Goal Created ‚Üí Invitations Sent ‚Üí Members Respond
  ‚Üì
All Responded? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí At least 1 accepted? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí ‚úÖ Can Update
                                               ‚Üí No  ‚Üí ‚ùå Blocked
               ‚Üí No  ‚Üí ‚ùå Blocked (waiting for responses)
```

**Files:**
- `lib/group-goals.ts` - Permission check functions
- `components/group-goals/group-goal-detail.tsx` - Alert display

---

### 6. Fixed Firebase Web Push Notifications ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Corrected logo path from `/commitly-logo.png` to `/Comittly-logo.png`
- Added proper badge icon (`/icon-192x192.png`)
- Enhanced notification with:
  - Vibration pattern: `[200, 100, 200]`
  - Two actions: View and Dismiss
  - `requireInteraction: true` for important notifications

**File:**
- `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js` - Service worker configuration

---

### 7. Fixed Seasonal Goal Accountability Partners ‚úÖ
**Implementation:**
- Added accountability partner request creation for seasonal goals
- Sends requests to selected partners when goal is created
- Creates notifications for each partner
- Shows success toast: "Accountability partner requests sent to X partner(s)"
