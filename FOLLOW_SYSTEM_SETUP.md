# Follow System Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Frontend components are ready** - All follow system components are implemented and working
✅ **API routes have error handling** - Graceful fallback when database tables don't exist
✅ **Partners page updated** - Proper tabs for Following, Followers, Follow Requests, etc.

## Database Migration Required

The follow system needs database tables to function properly. The API routes will show empty results until the migration is run.

### To run the migration:

1. **Via Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Supabase project
   - Navigate to SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of: `complete-follow-system-migration.sql`
   - Click "Run"

2. **Via psql (if you have direct database access):**
   ```bash
   psql -f complete-follow-system-migration.sql
   ```

### What the migration creates:
- `follows` table with status support (pending/accepted/blocked)
- Database functions for follow status checking
- Triggers for automatic count updates
- Added columns to `profiles` table (followers_count, following_count, is_private)

## After Migration

Once the migration is complete:
- ✅ Follow/Unfollow buttons will work
- ✅ Following/Followers tabs will show actual data
- ✅ Follow requests will work for private accounts
- ✅ Real-time count updates
- ✅ Mutual follow detection

## Testing

1. Go to `/partners` page
2. Try following users in the "Discover" tab
3. Check "Following" and "Followers" tabs
4. Test follow request functionality

## Current Behavior (Without Migration)

The partners page will still work but show:
- Empty Following/Followers lists
- Follow buttons showing "Follow system not available" messages
- Zero counts in the stats

This is normal and expected until the database migration is run.
