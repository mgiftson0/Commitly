# 🚀 GitHub Setup Complete!

Your Commitly project is now connected to: **https://github.com/mgiftson0/Commitly.git**

---

## ✅ What I've Done

1. ✅ Initialized Git repository
2. ✅ Connected to your GitHub repo
3. ✅ Created `.gitignore` (protects sensitive files)
4. ✅ Created `.env.example` (template for environment variables)

---

## 📋 Next Steps - Push to GitHub

### Option 1: Push from Here (I can do this for you)

I can commit and push all the files to your GitHub repo. Just say "push to GitHub" and I'll:
- Add all files
- Create initial commit
- Push to main branch

### Option 2: Push from Your Local Machine

After you clone the repo on your computer, run:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Commitly goal tracking platform"
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🔐 Important: Environment Variables

**DO NOT commit `.env.local`** - it's already in `.gitignore`

Instead, I've created `.env.example` which shows what variables are needed.

When you clone on your machine:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual Supabase credentials
3. Never commit `.env.local` to GitHub

## 📁 What's Being Pushed

- ✅ All 9 pages (landing, auth, dashboard, goals, etc.)
- ✅ Complete database schema (`setup-schema.sql`)
- ✅ All components and UI files
- ✅ Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- ✅ Documentation (README, setup guides)
- ❌ `.env.local` (protected - not pushed)
- ❌ `node_modules/` (protected - not pushed)
- ❌ `.next/` build files (protected - not pushed)

## 🎯 Ready to Push?

**Would you like me to push the code to GitHub now?**

Just say "yes" or "push to GitHub" and I'll handle it! 🚀

Or if you prefer to do it manually from your local machine, that works too!
