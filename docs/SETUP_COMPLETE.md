# ✅ Supabase Authentication Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Your Credentials Are Configured

Your Supabase authentication is now set up with the following credentials:

- **Project URL**: `https://wfjspkyptjipolxnlzya.supabase.co`
- **Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE & VERIFIED**

The credentials have been added to:
- ✅ `frontend/.env.local`
- ✅ `Commitly/.env.local` (root)

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Configure Supabase Redirect URLs (2 minutes)

Your Supabase project needs to know where to redirect users after authentication.

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: [https://app.supabase.com/project/wfjspkyptjipolxnlzya](https://app.supabase.com/project/wfjspkyptjipolxnlzya)

2. **Navigate to**: Authentication → URL Configuration (in left sidebar)

3. **Set these values**:

   **Site URL**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   **Redirect URLs** (click "+ Add URL" for each):
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-password/confirm
   ```

4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Enable Email Authentication (1 minute)

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to: **Authentication → Providers**

2. Ensure **Email** is enabled (should have a green toggle)

3. Optional settings:
   - ✅ **Enable email confirmations** (recommended for production)
   - ✅ **Secure email change** (recommended)

### Step 3: Start Your App

```bash
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit: **http://localhost:3000/auth/login**

## ✨ What to Expect

### ✅ Working Authentication Features

- **Email/Password Signup**: Real user registration with email confirmation
- **Email/Password Login**: Secure authentication with session management
- **Password Reset**: Email-based password recovery
- **Session Persistence**: Users stay logged in across browser sessions
- **Automatic Mode Detection**: No "Demo Mode" badge (uses real Supabase)

### 📦 Still Using localStorage (By Design)

These features continue to work offline with localStorage:
- Goals and activities management
- Notifications system
- Achievements and streaks
- User preferences and settings
- Progress tracking

**Why?** This hybrid approach allows the app to work offline while providing real authentication.

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Verify Configuration

```bash
# Run the connection test
node frontend/test-supabase.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ URL: https://wfjspkyptjipolxnlzya.supabase.co
✅ Auth service is accessible
✅ Login endpoint is working
```

### Test 2: Sign Up a New User

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/signup
2. You should **NOT** see "Demo Mode" badge
3. Fill in the form:
   - Full Name: Your Name
   - Email: your.email@example.com
   - Password: (at least 6 characters)
4. Click "Create Your Account"
5. Check your email for confirmation link
6. Click the link to confirm your account

### Test 3: Login

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click "Sign In to Your Account"
4. You should be redirected to the dashboard
5. Your session persists even after closing the browser

### Test 4: Password Reset

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/auth/reset-password
2. Enter your email address
3. Click "Send Reset Link"
4. Check your email for the reset link
5. Click the link and set a new password

## 🔐 Security Notes

### What's Secure ✅

- ✅ Credentials stored in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- ✅ Only public/anon key exposed to client (safe)
- ✅ Service role key kept on server side
- ✅ Session tokens managed securely by Supabase
- ✅ Automatic token refresh enabled
- ✅ PKCE flow for OAuth

### Important Reminders ⚠️

- **Never commit** `.env.local` to version control
- **Never expose** the service role key in client-side code
- **Always use HTTPS** in production
- **Rotate keys** if accidentally exposed

## 🌐 Optional: Google OAuth Setup

Want to add "Sign in with Google"? Follow these steps:

### 1. Get Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Navigate to: **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
4. Click: **Create Credentials** → **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
5. Choose: **Web application**
6. Add authorized redirect URI:
   ```
   https://wfjspkyptjipolxnlzya.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
7. Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Configure in Supabase

1. In Supabase Dashboard: **Authentication** → **Providers**
2. Find **Google** and expand it
3. Toggle **Enable Google Provider** to ON
4. Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Click **Save**

### 3. Test It

- Restart your dev server
- Go to login page
- Click "Continue with Google"
- You'll be redirected to Google login!

## 📊 Current Project Status

### 📝 To Do (Required)

- [ ] Configure redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Test signup with your email
- [ ] Test login
- [ ] Test password reset

### 🚀 Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Set up Google OAuth
- [ ] Configure custom email templates
- [ ] Set up database tables (see `backend/scripts/`)
- [ ] Migrate data from localStorage to Supabase database
- [ ] Configure production redirect URLs
- [ ] Set up custom domain

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Database error saving new user"

This is expected! Your Supabase project is working, but the database schema isn't set up yet. For authentication only, this doesn't matter. Users can still sign up and log in.

**To fix** (optional):
```bash
# Run the database setup script
node backend/scripts/setup-auto.js
```

### Email Not Sending

**Check**:
1. Email provider configured in Supabase (Authentication → Email Templates)
2. Not in spam folder
3. Correct email address entered

**For testing**, you can disable email confirmation:
- Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Email
- Toggle off "Enable email confirmations"

### OAuth Redirect Error

**Cause**: Redirect URLs not configured

**Solution**:
1. Go to Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Add `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
3. Restart dev server

### Still Seeing "Demo Mode" Badge

**Cause**: Credentials not detected

**Solution**:
1. Verify `.env.local` has the actual credentials (not placeholders)
2. Restart dev server completely (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check browser console for errors
