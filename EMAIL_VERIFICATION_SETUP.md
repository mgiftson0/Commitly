# Email Verification Not Working - Complete Fix Guide

## Issue
You're experiencing two problems:
1. **Signup button redirects to KYC immediately** (before signup completes)
2. **Not receiving verification emails**

---

## Root Causes & Solutions

### Problem 1: Old Session Causing KYC Redirect

**Cause**: You likely have an old session stored from previous testing. The middleware sees you're "logged in" and redirects you to KYC.

**Solution**: Clear your browser data and sessions.

#### Quick Fix - Clear Session
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Clear the following:
   - **Cookies**: Delete all cookies for `localhost:3000`
   - **Local Storage**: Clear all items
   - **Session Storage**: Clear all items
4. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl + Shift + R)

#### OR Use This Route
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/clear-session`
This will automatically clear your session and redirect to login.

### Problem 2: Not Receiving Verification Emails

**Cause**: Supabase email confirmation is not properly configured.

#### Step-by-Step Supabase Configuration

##### 1. Enable Email Confirmation
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: Authentication → Providers → Email
4. Scroll down to "Confirm email"
5. ✅ CHECK the box "Enable email confirmations"
6. Click "Save"
```

##### 2. Configure Email Templates
```
1. Still in Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to: Authentication → Email Templates
3. Select "Confirm signup" template
4. Update the confirmation URL to:
   {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback
   
5. Select "Magic Link" template (optional)
6. Update to: {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback

7. Select "Change Email Address" template (optional)
8. Update to: {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback

9. Click "Save" for each template
```

##### 3. Verify SMTP Settings (Important!)
```
By default, Supabase uses their SMTP for development.

For Production:
1. Go to: Project Settings → Auth
2. Scroll to "SMTP Settings"
3. If using custom SMTP, verify:
   - Host is correct
   - Port is correct
   - Username is correct
   - Password is correct
   - Sender email is verified
```

##### 4. Check Rate Limits
```
Supabase has email rate limits:
- Development: Limited to prevent spam
- Production: Higher limits

If you've signed up multiple times:
1. Wait 1 hour before trying again
2. OR check Supabase logs for rate limit errors:
   - Dashboard → Logs → Auth Logs
```

##### 5. Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check your .env.local file has correct values:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...your-key-here

# Make sure these match your Supabase project!
```

---

## Testing Email Verification

### Test 1: Check Supabase Logs
```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: Logs → Auth Logs
3. Try to sign up
4. Check if you see:
   - "Signup" event
   - "Email sent" event
   - Any error messages
```

### Test 2: Check Spam/Junk Folder
- Verification emails sometimes go to spam
- Check your email spam/junk folder
- Add `noreply@mail.app.supabase.io` to contacts

### Test 3: Try Different Email
```
1. Clear session first
2. Try signing up with a different email domain
   - If using Gmail, try Outlook
   - If using Outlook, try Gmail
3. Some email providers block automated emails
```

### Test 4: Check Browser Console
```
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try signing up
4. Look for errors like:
   - "Supabase is not configured"
   - Network errors
   - 400/500 status codes
```

## Development Workaround (FOR TESTING ONLY)

If you need to test without email verification temporarily:

### Disable Email Confirmation (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION)
```
1. Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → Providers → Email
3. ✅ UNCHECK "Enable email confirmations"
4. Save

⚠️ WARNING: This allows users to access the app without verifying their email!
⚠️ Re-enable this before going to production!
```

### Manual Email Verification (FOR DEVELOPMENT)
```
1. Sign up a user
2. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
3. Find the user you just created
4. You'll see "Email Confirmed" status
5. Click the user
6. Manually set email_confirmed_at to current timestamp
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "User already exists" error
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
2. Find and delete the existing user
3. Try signing up again

### Issue: Email arrives but link doesn't work
**Solution**:
1. Check the email template URL is correct: `/auth/callback`
2. Make sure your app is running on the correct port
3. Check for CORS issues in browser console

**Solution**:
1. Check Supabase Auth Logs for errors
2. Verify SMTP settings in Supabase
3. Try a different email provider
4. Contact Supabase support if using custom SMTP

### Issue: "Invalid link" error after clicking email

```

### Email Template URL (for Supabase)
```
{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/callback
```

console.log('Supabase URL:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('Has Anon Key:', !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
```

## Expected Behavior

✅ **Correct Flow**:
1. Visit `/auth/signup` → Form loads
2. Fill form → Submit
3. See success message → Redirect to `/auth/login`
4. Email arrives within 1-2 minutes
5. Click email link → Opens `/auth/callback`
6. Callback verifies → Redirects to `/auth/kyc`
7. Complete KYC → Redirects to `/dashboard`

❌ **What You're Experiencing**:
- Visit `/auth/signup` → Immediately redirects to `/auth/kyc` (old session issue)
- Sign up → No email arrives (configuration issue)
